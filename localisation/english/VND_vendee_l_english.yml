  # Events
  vendee.1.a: "Rescue The King"
  vendee.1.b: "In the dead of night, Vendéen loyalists executed a daring operation to extract the young Louis XVII from his captors in Paris. The boy-king, weak from months of imprisonment and mistreatment, was spirited away through secret passages and hidden routes known only to the most faithful royalists.\n\nAs the rescue party made their desperate flight toward Vendéen-held territory, they encountered an unexpected group of armed men blocking the forest road. Tension mounted as both sides raised their weapons—until their leader stepped forward with raised hands.\n\n'Hold your fire! We are Federalists from the Gironde,' the man announced. 'We may not share your dreams of absolute monarchy, but we share your hatred of the Jacobin tyranny. That boy deserves to live, whatever crown he may or may not wear.'\n\nThe Federalist commander introduced himself and his men—former National Guardsmen, moderate republicans, and constitutional monarchists who had fled the Terror. They offered supplies, fresh horses, and safe passage through territories they still influenced.\n\n'We seek a France of laws and liberty,' he continued, 'not the blood-soaked madness of Robespierre. Perhaps, in time, we might find common cause. A constitutional settlement, perhaps? The boy could reign, but under a charter that protects the rights of all Frenchmen.'\n\nThe Vendéen commanders faced a choice: accept these unlikely allies and consider their political proposal, or view them as republicans nonetheless—traitors who had once supported the Revolution that murdered the King."
  vendee.1.c: "The King thanks you for your service and assistance."
  vendee.1.d: "Republicans are republicans. Kill them all."
  vendee_federalist_alliance: "You choose to cooperate with federalist in Rescue The king Event"
  VND_royalist_path: "You choose to kill the federalist in Rescue The king Event"
  vendee.2.a: "Behind Closed Doors"
  vendee.2.b: "The rescue party finally reached the safety of a Vendéen outpost as dawn broke over the Loire valley. Louis XVII, still dressed in the tattered prison clothes that hung loosely on his malnourished frame, was brought into a warm room—perhaps the first warmth he had felt in months.\n\nAs loyal officers knelt before their young sovereign, the boy remained silent, his eyes hollow and distant. A physician was summoned, and food was brought, though the child barely touched it. It was only when an elderly officer—a man who had once served at Versailles—gently asked about his captivity that the dam finally broke.\n\nIn a quiet, broken voice, Louis XVII began to speak of the Temple Prison. He told of the darkness of his cell, where sunlight never reached. Of the screams he heard through the walls—his mother's screams, his aunt's prayers, sounds that haunted his sleepless nights. He spoke of Simon the cobbler, the brutal guardian appointed by the Committee, who had beaten him for refusing to denounce his own mother as a whore and a traitor.\n\n'They made me sing their songs,' the boy whispered, tears streaming down his face. 'The songs about killing kings. They laughed when I cried. They... they told me Maman was dead. That they had killed her. Is it true? Is she...?'\n\nThe room fell into awful silence. Every man present felt his blood turn to ice, then to fire. The child before them had been broken by monsters who called themselves liberators. Some officers wept openly. Others gripped their sword hilts until their knuckles turned white.\n\nThis was what the Revolution had done. This was what they were fighting against. Not abstract principles or political philosophy—but this. A tortured child who had committed no crime except being born into the wrong family.\n\nThe boy-king would need time to heal, if such wounds ever could heal. But one thing was certain: the men of the Vendée now knew, with absolute clarity, that their cause was just."
  vendee.2.c: "The Republic will answer for these crimes."
  vendee.2.d: "We must protect him from ever suffering again."
  vendee.3.a: "The Question of Women soldier"
  vendee.3.b: "The civil war has ended. The tricolor lies trampled in the mud, replaced once more by the white banner of the Bourbons. Church bells ring across a France exhausted by years of bloodshed. But in the victory parades, something unprecedented catches the eye of foreign observers and traditionalists alike—women in uniform, bearing arms, marching alongside their male comrades.\n\nThe women of the Vendée had taken up arms out of desperate necessity. When the Republic's armies came with fire and blade, when priests were drowned and villages burned, the women fought beside their fathers, husbands, and brothers. Some became scouts and messengers. Others loaded muskets and tended the wounded. A few, like the legendary Marie-Louise Victoire de Donnissan, led men into battle themselves.\n\nNow, with peace restored, these women await the young King's judgment. Many wish to return to their homes, their farms, their families—the war having taken enough from them already. But others, having tasted freedom and purpose in the ranks, petition to remain in service. They argue that they have proven themselves in blood, that they have earned the right to serve France as soldiers.\n\nThe court is divided. Conservative advisors argue that women bearing arms violates natural order and tradition—that France must return to proper Christian values after years of revolutionary chaos. Others, particularly younger officers who fought alongside these women, argue that merit and loyalty matter more than tradition, that these women bled for the King and deserve recognition.\n\nThe Catholic bishops offer no clear guidance, torn between admiration for these Judith-like defenders of the faith and concern for proper social order.\n\nLouis XVII, now a young man hardened by childhood suffering and years of war, must decide. Will he honor tradition and demobilize all female soldiers? Will he create a special auxiliary corps that acknowledges their service while maintaining separation? Or will he take the radical step of allowing them to serve as equals—a decision that would shock every court in Europe?"
  vendee.3.c: "Women soldiers are discharged with honors and pensions."
  vendee.3.d: "Let each woman choose her own path freely."
