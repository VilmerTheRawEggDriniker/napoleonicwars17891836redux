  vendee.1.a: "Rescue The King"
  vendee.1.b: "In the dead of night, Vendéen loyalists executed a daring operation to extract the young Louis XVII from his captors in Paris. The boy-king, weak from months of imprisonment and mistreatment, was spirited away through secret passages and hidden routes known only to the most faithful royalists.\n\nAs the rescue party made their desperate flight toward Vendéen-held territory, they encountered an unexpected group of armed men blocking the forest road. Tension mounted as both sides raised their weapons—until their leader stepped forward with raised hands.\n\n'Hold your fire! We are Federalists from the Gironde,' the man announced. 'We may not share your dreams of absolute monarchy, but we share your hatred of the Jacobin tyranny. That boy deserves to live, whatever crown he may or may not wear.'\n\nThe Federalist commander introduced himself and his men—former National Guardsmen, moderate republicans, and constitutional monarchists who had fled the Terror. They offered supplies, fresh horses, and safe passage through territories they still influenced.\n\n'We seek a France of laws and liberty,' he continued, 'not the blood-soaked madness of Robespierre. Perhaps, in time, we might find common cause. A constitutional settlement, perhaps? The boy could reign, but under a charter that protects the rights of all Frenchmen.'\n\nThe Vendéen commanders faced a choice: accept these unlikely allies and consider their political proposal, or view them as republicans nonetheless—traitors who had once supported the Revolution that murdered the King."
  vendee.1.c: "The King thanks you for your service and assistance."
  vendee.1.d: "Republicans are republicans. Kill them all."
  vendee_federalist_alliance: "You choose to cooperate with federalist in Rescue The king Event"
  VND_royalist_path: "You choose to kill the federalist in Rescue The king Event"
  vendee.2.a: "Behind Closed Doors"
  vendee.2.b: "The rescue party finally reached the safety of a Vendéen outpost as dawn broke over the Loire valley. Louis XVII, still dressed in the tattered prison clothes that hung loosely on his malnourished frame, was brought into a warm room—perhaps the first warmth he had felt in months.\n\nAs loyal officers knelt before their young sovereign, the boy remained silent, his eyes hollow and distant. A physician was summoned, and food was brought, though the child barely touched it. It was only when an elderly officer—a man who had once served at Versailles—gently asked about his captivity that the dam finally broke.\n\nIn a quiet, broken voice, Louis XVII began to speak of the Temple Prison. He told of the darkness of his cell, where sunlight never reached. Of the screams he heard through the walls—his mother's screams, his aunt's prayers, sounds that haunted his sleepless nights. He spoke of Simon the cobbler, the brutal guardian appointed by the Committee, who had beaten him for refusing to denounce his own mother as a whore and a traitor.\n\n'They made me sing their songs,' the boy whispered, tears streaming down his face. 'The songs about killing kings. They laughed when I cried. They... they told me Maman was dead. That they had killed her. Is it true? Is she...?'\n\nThe room fell into awful silence. Every man present felt his blood turn to ice, then to fire. The child before them had been broken by monsters who called themselves liberators. Some officers wept openly. Others gripped their sword hilts until their knuckles turned white.\n\nThis was what the Revolution had done. This was what they were fighting against. Not abstract principles or political philosophy—but this. A tortured child who had committed no crime except being born into the wrong family.\n\nThe boy-king would need time to heal, if such wounds ever could heal. But one thing was certain: the men of the Vendée now knew, with absolute clarity, that their cause was just."
  vendee.2.c: "The Republic will answer for these crimes."
  vendee.2.d: "We must protect him from ever suffering again."
  vendee.3.a: "The Question of Women soldier"
  vendee.3.b: "The civil war has ended. The tricolor lies trampled in the mud, replaced once more by the white banner of the Bourbons. Church bells ring across a France exhausted by years of bloodshed. But in the victory parades, something unprecedented catches the eye of foreign observers and traditionalists alike—women in uniform, bearing arms, marching alongside their male comrades.\n\nThe women of the Vendée had taken up arms out of desperate necessity. When the Republic's armies came with fire and blade, when priests were drowned and villages burned, the women fought beside their fathers, husbands, and brothers. Some became scouts and messengers. Others loaded muskets and tended the wounded. A few, like the legendary Marie-Louise Victoire de Donnissan, led men into battle themselves.\n\nNow, with peace restored, these women await the young King's judgment. Many wish to return to their homes, their farms, their families—the war having taken enough from them already. But others, having tasted freedom and purpose in the ranks, petition to remain in service. They argue that they have proven themselves in blood, that they have earned the right to serve France as soldiers.\n\nThe court is divided. Conservative advisors argue that women bearing arms violates natural order and tradition—that France must return to proper Christian values after years of revolutionary chaos. Others, particularly younger officers who fought alongside these women, argue that merit and loyalty matter more than tradition, that these women bled for the King and deserve recognition.\n\nThe Catholic bishops offer no clear guidance, torn between admiration for these Judith-like defenders of the faith and concern for proper social order.\n\nLouis XVII, now a young man hardened by childhood suffering and years of war, must decide. Will he honor tradition and demobilize all female soldiers? Will he create a special auxiliary corps that acknowledges their service while maintaining separation? Or will he take the radical step of allowing them to serve as equals—a decision that would shock every court in Europe?"
  vendee.3.c: "Women soldiers are discharged with honors and pensions."
  vendee.3.d: "Let each woman choose her own path freely."
  french_surrender_done: "Republic Regime is defeated"
  vendee.4.a: "The Empty Throne"
  vendee.4.b: "The great golden gates of Versailles swung open for the first time in years, their hinges groaning like the ghosts of the old regime. Louis XVII sat motionless in the royal carriage as it passed through, his face pale and unreadable. The palace that should have been his childhood home had become a monument to everything he had lost.\n\nThe Republic had fallen. Paris had surrendered after the Coalition forces breached the final barricades. The revolutionary government collapsed into chaos as former Jacobins fled or turned on each other. Some tried to escape abroad; others were dragged from hiding by vengeful crowds. The Committee of Public Safety was no more. The guillotine in the Place de la Révolution stood silent, its blade rusted with the blood of thousands.\n\nAs the young King stepped from his carriage, he stood before the palace where his father had once ruled, where his mother had walked through glittering halls, where his aunt had prayed in the chapel. All of them were gone now—murdered by the Revolution that had promised liberty and delivered only death.\n\nThe palace itself bore the scars of revolutionary fervor. Paintings had been slashed, royal symbols defaced, furniture looted or burned. The Hall of Mirrors, once the greatest room in Europe, was covered in dust and grime. Yet it still stood, wounded but unbroken, like France itself.\n\nVendéen soldiers and Coalition troops lined the courtyards, while crowds gathered at the gates—some weeping with joy at the restoration, others watching in sullen silence, still loyal to republican ideals even in defeat. The bishops waited to offer prayers of thanksgiving. Emigré nobles who had fled years ago now rushed forward, eager to reclaim their positions and properties.\n\nLouis XVII stood at the threshold of his inheritance. He was no longer the terrified boy who had been dragged from this palace by revolutionary mobs. He was no longer the broken child who wept in a prison cell. He was a young man who had survived hell itself and emerged victorious.\n\nBut as he looked up at the vast facade of Versailles, one question burned in his mind: What kind of France would he build from the ashes of the Republic? Would he restore the old order that had fallen so catastrophically? Would he forge something new? Would he show mercy to his enemies, or would the guillotine simply change hands?\n\nThe fate of France now rested on the shoulders of a king who had known only suffering, war, and loss. History held its breath."
  vendee.4.c: "Long Live The Kingdom!"
  VND_lafayette_general_tt: "§BYou unlock Lafayette path§!"
  vendee_history_text: "We are the people of the Vendée - peasants, priests, and nobles united against the tyranny of the Revolution\n\nWhen the Republic demanded our sons for their armies and persecuted our Catholic faith, we rose in revolt.\n\nThe bocage is our fortress, our faith is our strength, and our cause is just. For God and the King!"
  VND_return_church_lands: "Return the Church Lands"
  VND_return_church_lands_desc: "In the furnace of the civil war, our cause bleeds in the parishes and market squares of the Loire.

  vendee.100.t:0 "The Question of Lafayette"
  vendee.100.d:0 "A courier from Vienna arrived at court bearing unexpected news—and an unexpected prisoner. The Austrians, having held the Marquis de Lafayette in their fortress at Olmütz for years, have decided his fate is no longer their concern. With characteristic Habsburg pragmatism, they have transferred the famous general to Vendéen custody, washing their hands of a man who embarrasses all sides.\n\nGilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, now stands in chains before the court of the young King he once served—and whose family he failed to save. The 'Hero of Two Worlds' who fought for American liberty and French reform now appears gaunt and aged, his revolutionary ideals having led to nothing but terror and tyranny.\n\nThe constitutional monarchists see an opportunity. Lafayette championed a British-style monarchy with the King as a symbolic figurehead—precisely what they envision for France's future. His prestige, especially with the Americans, could legitimize a moderate settlement. 'He made mistakes,' they argue, 'but he tried to save Louis XVI. He fled the Jacobins just as we did.'\n\nThe absolutists are incensed. 'This man stripped your father of his powers!' they remind the King. 'He commanded the mob that imprisoned the Royal Family at the Tuileries! His constitutional fantasies paved the road to the guillotine! He is a traitor who deserves a traitor's death!'\n\nThe Federalist advisors offer a middle path: clemency in exchange for public service. Lafayette's military expertise and international connections could prove valuable, and mercy would demonstrate that constitutional monarchy is not vengeance.\n\nLouis XVII studies the prisoner in silence. Here stands the man who once swore to protect the Royal Family, who commanded the National Guard that failed to stop the Revolution's descent into madness. The King remembers his father's letters, which spoke of Lafayette with both disappointment and a strange, persistent hope that the Marquis might yet prove loyal.\n\nWhat justice does Lafayette deserve? The answer will define what kind of monarchy France shall become."
  vendee.100.a:0 "Full pardon and welcome."
  vendee.100.c:0 "Refuse any amnesty."

  vendee.110.t:0 "Fate of the Jacobins"
  vendee.110.d:0 "The war is done. The clubs are quiet. What now?\n\nIn prisons across France, hundreds of Jacobins await their fate. These are the men who had cheered at the guillotine, who had voted for the King's father's death, who had ordered the drownings at Nantes and the columns infernales through the Vendée. Some are unrepentant ideologues, still muttering about liberty and virtue even in their cells. Others are broken men, begging for mercy they never showed their own victims.\n\nThe court demands blood for blood. Families who lost fathers, sons, and daughters in the Vendée massacres cry out for justice. The Catholic bishops speak of righteous punishment for crimes against God and man. Even moderate voices acknowledge that some accountability must be demanded.\n\nYet Louis XVII has seen enough of revolutionary 'justice'—the mock trials, the tumbrels rolling toward the scaffold, the cheering crowds. He knows what it means to be helpless before judges who have already decided your guilt. The question haunts him in quiet moments... if he orders mass executions, how is he different from them?\n\nThree paths lie before the young King. He can exile the Jacobin leadership, scattering them across Europe as living warnings but avoiding further bloodshed. He can offer a general amnesty, drawing a line under the past and seeking reconciliation—a radical mercy that would shock both his own supporters and foreign courts. Or he can give the people what they demand. trials, sentences, and the justice of the scaffold.\n\nThe Vendéen veterans who saved him from the Temple watch him carefully, waiting to see what kind of king the boy they rescued will become."
  vendee.110.a:0 "Exile the leadership."
  vendee.110.b:0 "General amnesty."
  vendee.110.c:0 "Harsh justice."

  vendee.200.t:0 "Trial of Lafayette"
  vendee.200.d: "The great hall of the Vendéen headquarters falls silent as guards drag the prisoner forward. Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette—once called the 'Hero of Two Worlds'—now stands in chains before a tribunal of royalist officers and Catholic clergy. The Austrians, having tired of housing this embarrassment, have delivered him into Vendéen hands with a simple message: 'Do with him as you please.'\n\nThe charges are read aloud, each one met with growls of anger from the assembled loyalists. Treason against the Crown. Complicity in the imprisonment of the Royal Family. Commanding the forces that failed—or refused—to protect Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Propagating the poisonous doctrines of constitutional monarchy that weakened the throne and enabled the Jacobin terror.\n\n'I served France,' Lafayette protests weakly. 'I tried to save the King. I fled the Revolution when it turned to madness—'\n\n'You created that madness!' an officer shouts. 'Your American ideals, your National Assembly, your constitutional fantasies—all of it led to the guillotine! The King's blood is on your hands as surely as if you wielded the blade yourself!'\n\nThe prosecution presents damning evidence: Lafayette's letters advocating limits on royal power, his orders to the National Guard during the October Days when the mob dragged the Royal Family from Versailles, his failure to prevent the flight to Varennes from becoming a disaster. Most damningly, they read his pamphlets calling for a monarchy 'restrained by law'—words that sound like blasphemy in this room of absolute monarchists.\n\nYet even here, some voices counsel caution. An elderly nobleman notes that Lafayette was imprisoned by the very revolutionaries he supposedly served—proof that even the Jacobins saw him as an enemy. A priest reminds the court that vengeance belongs to God, and that mercy is a kingly virtue. A pragmatic general suggests that executing a man famous in America and England might damage Vendée's hopes for foreign recognition and support.\n\nBut the civil war still rages. Republican armies still burn churches and murder priests across France. The traumatized young King, scarred by years of revolutionary brutality, must decide: Does Lafayette deserve the mercy he failed to show the Royal Family? Or does justice demand that this architect of revolution face the same fate he helped bring upon his King?"
  vendee.200.a:0 "Guilty. He hangs at dawn as a traitor to the Crown."
  vendee.200.b:0 "Guilty. Life imprisonment in a fortress—let him rot."
  vendee.200.c:0 "Exile him to America. Let him live with his failure."

  vendee.210.t:0 "Fate of the National Assembly"
  vendee.210.d:0 "The National Assembly building stands empty, its chambers once filled with revolutionary fervor now silent and cold. This was where it all began—where the Third Estate declared itself the voice of France, where the King's authority was first challenged, where the Revolution was born.\n\nFor those who followed the absolutist path, who rejected compromise with Federalists and shed blood to restore the throne's full power, the Assembly represents everything they fought against. It is a monument to rebellion, a temple of regicide, the birthplace of France's nightmare.\n\nYet some pragmatic advisors argue the institution might be preserved in neutered form—an advisory body with no real power, maintaining the appearance of consultation while the King rules as his ancestors did. 'Let them debate and advise,' one minister suggests, 'but give them no authority to constrain Your Majesty.'\n\nOthers, driven by righteous fury and memories of the Terror, demand harsher measures. 'The very men who sat in those seats voted for your father's death, Your Majesty,' a hardline royalist whispers. 'They cheered when the Queen went to the scaffold. They starved you in darkness as a child. The Assembly must not merely be dissolved—its members must answer for their crimes. Root and branch, every last one.'\n\nLouis XVII stands before a window overlooking the gardens, his back to his councilors. His hands are clasped behind him, white-knuckled. The scars of the Temple Prison still mark his soul, and these men ask him to decide the fate of those who created that hell.\n\nThe young King's decision will set the tone for his entire reign. Will he rule with mercy or vengeance? Will pragmatism or principle guide his hand?"
