  absolute_monarchy:0 "Absolute Monarchy"
  absolute_monarchy_desc:0 "Sovereignty is indivisible and vested in the crown. The monarch claims ultimate authority over state and society, tolerating councils only as instruments of will."
  constitution_monarchy:0 "Constitution Monarchy"
  constitution_monarchy_desc:0 "The crown reigns under law. Sovereignty is shared between a hereditary monarch and representative institutions, with executive power limited by a written constitution. Government is formed by accountable ministers, civil liberties are protected in principle, and succession is separated from day-to-day politics to preserve continuity and stability."
  enlightened_absolutism:0 "Enlightened Abolutism"
  enlightened_absolutism_desc:0 "The ruler keeps authority undivided yet wields it with reason: codifying laws, pruning clerical privilege, tolerating faiths, and drilling a modern bureaucracy and schools into shape. Reform flows from the top for the “public good,” but the public does not get a vote. Everything for the people; nothing by the people."
  theocracy:0 "Theocracy"
  theocracy_desc:0 "Temporal power is wielded by spiritual authority. Law is interpreted as sacred mandate, the executive is fused with clergy, and legitimacy flows from doctrine rather than ballots. Dissent is framed as heresy, but order is stable so long as the faithful obey and the hierarchy remains united."
